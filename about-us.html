            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>Our journey started in 1995 at a lemonade stand set up in a small neighborhood in Hong Kong. What began as a small project led by two young, witty figures promoting their homemade lemonades to their neighbors soon grew into a locally-renowned business supplying its signature soft drinks to local retailers. With growing demand in our products, in 2009, after five years of extensive experimentation and research we substantially diversified our product lines, introducing energy drinks and cocktails. 2015 was another huge milestone for SipSation when we made our global expansion to mainland China, Singapore, and Thailand after seeing growing demand for our products from overseas. As we have continuously pushed our boundaries ever since to deliver joy and happiness to the world, <span class="highlight">our products are now being enjoyed in 11 countries around the world, focused on Asia and Europe</span>.</p>
